# gender-classification-transfer-learning

The code for the entire project is written in https://github.com/angwanqi/gender-classification-transfer-learning/blob/main/Transfer%20Learning.ipynb 

Just proceed to the jupyter notebook labelled **Transfer Learning.ipnyb** and press run and you will get everything you need present in the respective folders for you, ie. *weights* contains the best weights of the trained model, and *results* contains all the visualisations and data achieved from the evaluation of the model.

PS. the dataset is roughly 3GB (the code to download the dataset is present in the jupyter notebook) so hold your horses and don't get too excited just yet!
